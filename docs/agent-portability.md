# Agent Portability

Ponytail is an agent-portable skill distribution. The skills in `skills/` hold
the core behavior; host-specific files are adapters that make that behavior easy
to load in a given agent.

## Supported Adapters

| Host | Files | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|
| mimocode | `AGENTS.md`, `skills/`, `commands/` | Always-on rules from `AGENTS.md`, skills loaded on demand via the skill tool. |
| Generic agents | `AGENTS.md` or `skills/*/SKILL.md` | Copy the compact rule file or load the skill files directly. |

## Adapter Rule

Keep adapters thin. When a host supports skills, point it at the
existing `skills/` files. When a host only supports project
instructions, keep its copied rule text aligned with `AGENTS.md`.

## Portable Behavior

- `skills/ponytail/SKILL.md`: lazy senior dev mode
- `skills/ponytail-review/SKILL.md`: over-engineering review
- `skills/ponytail-audit/SKILL.md`: whole-repo over-engineering audit
- `skills/ponytail-debt/SKILL.md`: harvest `ponytail:` shortcuts into a tracked ledger
- `skills/ponytail-help/SKILL.md`: quick reference
- `AGENTS.md`: compact always-on instruction set for agents without skill support
